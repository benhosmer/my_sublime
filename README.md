MySublime
=========

This is my Sublime Text 2 configuration based on post of [@kennethreitz][kenneth] ,and my
goal is try to optimize the python experience and better support
to [web2py][web2py].

It's a compilation of better plugins thats include:

    - git support(commands and diff view)
    - pep8 autoformat
    - html helper(awesome!)
    - markdown preview
    - inline notation for syntax errors in many languages
    - nice snippets...very nice
    - json auto-formatter

Instalation
-----------

`python setup.py`

Requirements
--------------
- Python 2.7
- Ubuntu (only support yet)

ps: some packages will be intalled with this script to create a better
enviroment

TODO:

    [] integration with other OS(include other distros).

    [] many snippets for web2py

    [] Test script in earlier versions of python
